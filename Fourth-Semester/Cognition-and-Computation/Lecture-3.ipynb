    "   - Traditional models assume recognition is based solely on an assessment of **familiarity**.\n",
    "   - Familiarity follows a **Gaussian distribution**: items studied earlier become more familiar, shifting their distribution to the right.\n",
    "   - If recognition relied only on familiarity, receiver-operating characteristics (**ROC**) curves would be **symmetrical** with a slope of 1.\n",

    "## **ROC Curves & Experimental Evidence**:\n",
    "   - **ROC analysis** measures recognition memory by comparing **hit rates** (correct recognitions) with **false alarm rates** (incorrect recognitions).\n",
    "   - ROCs are often **asymmetrical** (slopes < 1), which SDT alone cannot explain.\n",
    "   - **Recollection process** explains why slopes decrease when performance improves.\n",

    "### **Two prominent models of recognition memory**  \n",

    "2. **Dual-Process Signal-Detection (DPSD) Model**  \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **UVSD Model:**\n",
    "   - Recognition is based on a **continuous** memory strength variable.\n",
    "   - Targets (previously seen items) have **greater variability** than lures (new items).\n",
    "   - Supports a **graded** recollection process (not all-or-none).\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Recognition is based on a **continuous** scale of memory strength, meaning items are judged based on how strongly they feel familiar.\n",
    "   - **Targets** (old items) are more **strength** than **lures** (new items) because some older and more remembered memories are stronger than others.\n",
    "   - This model suggests that recollection is not all-or-none, but rather a **gradual** process—some memories feel stronger and clearer than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **DPSD Model:**\n",
    "   - Recollection occurs **all-or-none** (either a memory is retrieved or it is not).\n",
    "   - Familiarity is modeled as a **continuous** process using signal detection.\n",
    "   - Used in neuroscience studies to estimate separate contributions of recollection and familiarity.\n",

    "![UVSD vs DPSD](../../Files/fourth-semester/cc/3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Figure A assumes all memories have similar variability, making recognition a simple familiarity-based decision.\n",
    "- Figure B (UVSD model) better reflects real-world memory, where some old items are remembered strongly and others weakly, leading to greater variability in targets compared to lures.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **(ROC) curves** fit better with **curvilinear** predictions of UVSD than the **linear** predictions of DPSD.\n",
    "- **Z-transformed ROCs (z-ROCs)** are mostly linear, as predicted by UVSD, contradicting the expected curvature from DPSD.\n",
    "- Studies suggest that **recollection is not all-or-none** but instead occurs in degrees.\n",
    "- Findings suggest that recognition memory is best understood as a **continuous** process rather than a mix of discrete processes."
