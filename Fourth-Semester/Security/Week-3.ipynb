    "\n",
    "## 1. Key Concepts in Access Control\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Access Control:** Process to allow only authorized users/programs to access or modify system resources.\n",
    "* Main steps when accessing a system:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **Identification:** Claiming who you are (e.g., user ID, badge).\n",
    "  2. **Authentication:** Verifying your identity claim (e.g., password, biometrics).\n",
    "  3. **Authorization:** Granting access to resources based on identity.\n",
    "  4. **Accountability:** Tracking who accessed what and when.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Identification Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "* Physical or digital ways to identify users or devices:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Badges, User IDs, Account Numbers, MAC/IP addresses.\n",
    "  * RFID tags (used in passports, goods), Email addresses (common but spoofable).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Authentication Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "* Verify identity using:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Knowledge:** Passwords, PINs, graphical passwords.\n",
    "  * **Possession:** Smart cards, tokens, USB devices.\n",
    "  * **Characteristics:** Biometrics (fingerprints, iris, voice, signature).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Multifactor authentication (MFA):** Use two or more methods for stronger security.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Biometric accuracy is measured by:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * False Reject Rate (FRR)\n",
    "  * False Accept Rate (FAR)\n",
    "  * Crossover Error Rate (CER)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Identity Management\n",
    "\n",
    "* Systems that **create, maintain, and revoke** user identities.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Challenges in large systems include privacy, linking to physical identity, and unforgeability.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **User vs. Identity vs. Subject:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * User: the real person or machine.\n",
    "  * Identity: entry in identity system linked to a user.\n",
    "  * Subject: system entity (e.g., process) acting with privileges.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **User Access Management:** Lifecycle from registration to removal of access.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Access Control Policies\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define who can access what, under which conditions.\n",
    "* Types of policies:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Discretionary Access Control (DAC):** Owner decides access; rights can be transferred.\n",
    "  * **Mandatory Access Control (MAC):** System/admin enforces strict rules based on labels; no transfer of rights.\n",
    "  * **Non-Discretionary Access Control:** Access based on roles or attributes; admin controls permissions.\n",
    "  * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Access granted based on roles (job functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Access Control Mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** List of permissions attached to each resource.\n",
    "* **Capabilities:** Tokens held by users defining their access rights.\n",
    "* ACLs are simpler to implement, but harder to check at runtime; capabilities are easier to check but harder to manage in big systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Privilege Classes in Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Owner:** Creator/admin of resource.\n",
    "* **Group:** Users grouped to share privileges.\n",
    "* **World:** All other users with minimal privileges.\n",
    "* **Superuser:** Has all privileges.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Separation of Duties (SoD)\n",
    "\n",
    "* To prevent insider abuse by limiting role combinations.\n",
    "* Example constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A user cannot hold conflicting roles simultaneously.\n",
    "  * Some roles require others to be assigned too.\n",
    "  * \"Four eyes principle\": At least two people must approve actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Multi-level Security Models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bell-LaPadula Model (Confidentiality)\n",
    "\n",
    "* No **read-up:** Users can’t read data above their clearance.\n",
    "* No **write-down:** Users can’t write data to lower clearance levels.\n",
    "* Used in military/government systems to protect classified info.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Biba Model (Integrity)\n",
    "\n",
    "* No **read-down:** Users can’t read lower integrity data.\n",
    "* No **write-up:** Users can’t write to higher integrity levels.\n",
    "* Ensures data integrity by preventing unauthorized modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chinese Wall Model (Conflict of Interest)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prevents users from accessing data from competing companies.\n",
    "* User can access data from one company but blocked from rivals.\n",
    "* Write access allowed only if no conflicts exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Access control** ensures only authorized access to resources.\n",
    "* **Identification, Authentication, Authorization, and Accountability** are the core steps.\n",
    "* Various policies and models exist depending on use case and environment.\n",
    "* SoD limits risks from insiders.\n",
    "* Multi-level models like Bell-LaPadula and Biba protect confidentiality and integrity.\n",
    "* The Chinese Wall model addresses conflicts of interest in business contexts.\n",
