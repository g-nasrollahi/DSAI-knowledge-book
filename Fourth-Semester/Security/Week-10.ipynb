    "  - **Durability:** Once done, changes stay even if system crashes.\n",

    "  - **Input Validation**: Always check if input is safe.\n",

    "    - **Blacklisting:** Remove dangerous characters like `'`, `;`, `--`.\n",
    "    - **Escaping:** Replace dangerous characters with safe ones, e.g., `'` → `\\'`.\n",
    "  - **Whitelisting:** Only allow known good input formats.\n",
    "  - **Prepared Statements:** Use parameterized queries so inputs are never treated as code.\n",

    "  - **Cookies:** Key-value pairs stored by the browser and sent automatically on each request.\n",

    "      - Using tools like Firesheep, attackers can steal cookies on insecure Wi-Fi.\n",
    "    - **Server-Side Defenses for Cookies:**\n",
    "      - Make cookies expire quickly.\n",
    "      - Invalidate cookies when user logs out.\n",
    "      - Use different cookies for each session.\n",

    "        - **Referer Check:** Server checks where the request came from.\n",
    "        - **Secret Tokens:** Add a secret random token to each form or request that attackers cannot guess.\n",
    "        - **SameSite Cookie Attribute:** Controls if cookies are sent on cross-site requests.\n",
    "          - `Strict` = Cookies only sent to same-site requests. (most secure)\n",
    "          - `Lax` = Cookies sent on top-level navigation (clicking) but not on sub-requests (like images or frames).\n",
    "          - `None` = Cookies sent always (least secure).\n",

    "- **Same origin policy (SOP)**: Browsers restrict scripts to only access data from the same origin (domain, protocol, port).\n",
    "example:\n",
    "- **Cross-site Scripting (XSS)**: Attackers inject malicious scripts into trusted websites, can steal cookies, hijack sessions, or perform other harmful actions.\n",
    "  - **Persistent XSS:** Code stored on the server (e.g., comments).\n",
    "  - **Reflected XSS:** Code in URL or form input, reflected immediately in the page response."
