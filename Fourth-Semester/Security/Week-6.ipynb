    "- **Stack:** Stores function calls, local variables, return addresses in order. (LIFO - Last In, First Out).\n",
    "- **Heap:** Used for dynamic memory allocation (malloc/new). (Follows a more complex structure, not LIFO).\n",
    "- Functions push data onto the stack in a specific way (arguments, return address, frame pointer, local variables).\n",
    "- When a function is called:\n",
    "    - Arguments pushed in reverse order.\n",
    "    - Return address saved.\n",
    "    - Stack frame set up with local variables.\n",
    "- **Buffer** Ù‡s a fixed-size block of memory that holds data, like an array.\n",

    "- **Stack Overflow** (Stack Smashing): is a type of buffer overflow that attacker overwrite the **return address** on the stack and inject **malicious code (shellcode)** that runs a command.\n",
    "- **Nop Sled:** A technique where many \"no operation\" commands (NOPs) are placed before shellcode to help find the right jump address.\n",
    "- **Heap Overflow**: Similar to stack smashing but happens in memory allocated dynamically on the heap.\n",
    "- **Integer Overflow**: Happens when an arithmetic operation results in a value bigger than the variable can hold. Attackers can use this to corrupt data, bypass checks (e.g., authentication), or alter program behavior.\n",

    "```\n",
    "User input controls format string, can include %x, %s to read some values from stack (in hex) and leaks sensitive memory data like return addresses\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Race Conditions (TOCTOU - Time Of Check to Time Of Use)**\n",
    "    - Happens when a program checks a condition but the situation changes before the action is done.\n",
    "    - Attackers exploit this to cause unexpected behavior or security holes.\n",
    "    - Like a program checks permission of code changing sth on file first, but an attacker can change the file between that check and actual writing time gap, causing the program to write to a wrong or protected file.\n"
