    "## 1. Networking Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **computer network** is a group of connected devices that exchange information.\n",
    "* Devices use different methods to send data: WiFi (radio waves), cables (electricity), fiber optics (light).\n",
    "* Each device has an address called a **MAC address**.\n",
    "* Data travels through many **hops** (e.g., your PC → home router → university router → server).\n",
    "* Different protocols exist for different levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Application to Application: HTTP\n",
    "  * Network to Network: IP\n",
    "  * Device to Device: Ethernet\n",
    "* **Main problem:**\n",
    "  Network protocols are **insecure by default**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Data can be modified (spoofing).\n",
    "  * Data can be read (lack of confidentiality).\n",
    "  * Fake data can be sent (lack of authenticity).\n",
    "* More secure protocols (e.g., IPsec) exist but are harder to set up.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 2. Firewalls\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Firewall?\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **firewall** controls what data can enter or leave a network or device.\n",
    "* Usually placed at the network boundary (like a router).\n",
    "* Can also protect individual devices.\n",
    "* Implemented as software or hardware with special network access.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Packet-filtering Firewalls\n",
    "\n",
    "* The most common type.\n",
    "* Works by applying **rules** to packets (small data pieces).\n",
    "* Rules check things like source IP, destination IP, port, and protocol.\n",
    "* Actions can be: ACCEPT, REJECT, or DROP packets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Rules:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Rule | Src IP       | Dest IP     | Protocol | Src Port | Dest Port | Action |\n",
    "| ---- | ------------ | ----------- | -------- | -------- | --------- | ------ |\n",
    "| 1    | Your home IP | Your PC     | TCP      | \\*       | 22        | ACCEPT |\n",
    "| 2    | \\*           | Your PC     | TCP      | \\*       | 80        | ACCEPT |\n",
    "| 3    | Not your IP  | Not your IP | \\*       | \\*       | \\*        | DROP   |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stateless vs Stateful Firewalls\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stateless:** Checks packets individually, no memory of past packets.\n",
    "* **Stateful:** Keeps track of connections, more secure.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Packet-filtering Firewalls\n",
    "\n",
    "* Protect whole network by blocking bad packets early.\n",
    "* Simple and fast.\n",
    "* Widely available with good support.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cannot block all attacks.\n",
    "* Can be tricked by hiding traffic in allowed ports.\n",
    "* Complex rule sets can be hard to manage.\n",
    "* Only works if traffic passes through firewall (mobile data bypasses it).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proxy Firewalls\n",
    "\n",
    "* Works at **Application layer** (Layer 7).\n",
    "* Acts as an intermediary:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Client sends request to proxy.\n",
    "  2. Proxy sends request to target server.\n",
    "  3. Proxy receives response and sends it back to client.\n",
    "* Can be **explicit** (client knows about proxy) or **transparent** (client doesn’t know).\n",
    "* Can require authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Logs all activity (good for accountability).\n",
    "* Can cache content to reduce bandwidth.\n",
    "* Filters traffic more intelligently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Complex to set up and maintain.\n",
    "* Can slow down performance.\n",
    "* Must trust proxy with sensitive data (proxy sees all traffic).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tiered Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "* Combining different firewalls (packet-filtering + proxy) for better protection.\n",
    "* Layers of security between internet and internal network.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)\n",
    "\n",
    "* IDS **monitor network or system events** to detect unauthorized activity.\n",
    "* **Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)** can also take action to stop attacks (e.g., block traffic).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of IDS\n",
    "\n",
    "* **NIDS (Network-based IDS):** Listens to network traffic at key points like routers or switches.\n",
    "  Example tools: Snort, Suricata.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **HIDS (Host-based IDS):** Monitors activities on a specific device (logs, files, system calls).\n",
    "  Example tool: OSSEC.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Event Analysis Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Signature-based Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "* Uses known patterns (signatures) of attacks.\n",
    "* Fast and accurate if signatures are updated.\n",
    "* Can miss new or unknown attacks.\n",
    "* Example: Detects ping scans (nmap) by looking for empty ICMP packets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Anomaly-based Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learns normal behavior and alerts on deviations.\n",
    "* Can detect new attacks.\n",
    "* Hard to configure and can cause false alarms.\n",
    "* Requires good training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Base Rate Fallacy in IDS\n",
    "\n",
    "* If attacks are rare, even good IDS produce many false alarms.\n",
    "* Increasing sensitivity reduces missed attacks but increases false positives.\n",
    "* Decision on sensitivity depends on **threat model** and **risk tolerance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Tunneling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Tunneling?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Even if data is encrypted (like HTTPS), **metadata** (packet headers) is visible.\n",
    "* Metadata reveals who you talk to and when, which can reveal sensitive info.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tunneling Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "* Encapsulate your packets inside another secure tunnel through a trusted middleman.\n",
    "* Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Proxy:** Tunnels for specific applications.\n",
    "  * **VPN:** Tunnels all network traffic.\n",
    "* This hides your real origin and encrypts more data.\n",
    "* Used to securely access private networks remotely.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### TOR (Onion Routing)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multi-layer tunneling (tunnels inside tunnels).\n",
    "* Each relay removes one encryption layer, no single node knows the full path.\n",
    "* Provides strong anonymity but slower.\n",
    "* Not fully secure if you reveal your identity (logging in with real name).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
