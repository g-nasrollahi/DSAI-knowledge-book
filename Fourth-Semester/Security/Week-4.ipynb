    "  - **4) Transport** Responsible for sending data between hosts reliably or unreliably.\n",
    "    - TCP: Makes a connection before sending ordered data, slower but reliable, use 3 hand shakes(e.g. web pages, emails)\n",
    "    - UDP: Sends data without establishing a connection and recieve check, Faster but less reliable (e.g. video streaming, online gaming)\n",
    "  - **5) Network** Deals with routing and logical addressing (IP addresses).\n",
    "    - **Addressing** (IP of destination used until reached)\n",
    "    - **Fragmentation** (breaking large packets into smaller ones for transmission)\n",
    "    \n",
    "  - **6) Data Link** Makes sure data frames are error-free and handles hardware addresses (MAC).\n",
    "    - Logical Link Control (LLC): Manages connections between two peers, providing error and flow control\n",
    "    - Media Access Control (MAC): Transmits/Receives frames. Logical topologies and HW addresses are defined here.\n",

    "  - **Anonymizing proxies:** These hide who you really are when you browse the web.\n",
    "    - Example:* A company uses this so competitors can’t see what websites they visit.\n",
    "  - **Open proxy servers:** These let anyone use them to send web requests without restrictions. (Attackers -> hide their identity.)\n",
    "  - **Content filtering:** Block websites that are not allowed (like social media at work).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HTTP Tunneling**:\n",
    "  - Used to **get around firewalls or restrictions** but not to break security. It wraps (or hides) the real data inside regular web traffic (HTTP), so firewalls don’t block it.\n",
    "    - If a firewall blocks a video app, HTTP tunneling can let the app work by sending its data inside normal web requests.\n",

    "  - Key Parts:\n",
    "    - **AH (Authentication Header)**: Checks the data wasn’t changed and confirms the sender’s identity, sends a special code (hash) before each packet to prove it’s real.\n",
    "    - **ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload)**: Encrypts the data so only the receiver can read it and check data didn't got changed\n",
    "    - **Security Associations (SAs)**: Contract between two devices on using AH or ESPand encryption and authentication methods.\n",
    "  - **Modes**:\n",
    "    - **Transport Mode**: Only payload is encrypted, used for end-to-end communication.\n",
    "    - **Tunnel Mode**: Encrypts the entire packet, creating a new IP header, used for VPNs.\n",
    "- **IKE (Internet Key Exchange)**: Used to set up secure connections and manage keys for IPSec.\n",
    "  - **Phases**:\n",
    "    - **Phase 1**: Establishes a secure channel between two devices.\n",
    "    - **Phase 2**: Using that tunnel, they set up the real security rules (SAs) to protect the data communication.\n",
