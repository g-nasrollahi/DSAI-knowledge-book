    "\n",
    "* Spoofing: Someone impersonates owner to get sales data.\n",
    "* Tampering: Altering books or sales data.\n",
    "* Repudiation: Customer denies having sent requests.\n",
    "* DoS: Database offline, no response.\n",
    "* Elevation of Privilege (EoP): Customer gains higher privilege.\n",

    "## 12. Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "* Risk management quantifies and prioritizes threats.\n",
    "* Defensive strategies and controls should be based on assessed risks.\n",
    "* Threat modeling helps brainstorm possible attacks and improve preparation.\n",
    "* STRIDE is a practical method to identify common threats."
