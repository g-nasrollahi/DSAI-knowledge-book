    "\n",
    "* Encrypt fixed-sized blocks (e.g., 64 or 128 bits).\n",

    "* Example: **AES** (Advanced Encryption Standard)\n",

    "## 6. Block Cipher Modes of Operation (How blocks are encrypted)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ECB (Electronic Codebook)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Encrypt each block independently.\n",
    "* Problem: Same plaintext blocks → same ciphertext blocks (reveals patterns).\n",
    "* Example: Encrypt image pixel blocks → pattern visible in ciphertext.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each plaintext block XORed with previous ciphertext block before encryption.\n",
    "* Uses an **Initialization Vector (IV)** for first block.\n",
    "* Errors in one block affect that block and the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CFB (Cipher Feedback)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Turns block cipher into stream cipher.\n",
    "* Encrypts small parts (like bytes).\n",
    "* Self-synchronizing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### OFB (Output Feedback)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Similar to CFB but errors do not propagate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CTR (Counter Mode)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Uses counter + key to generate key stream.\n",
    "* Encryption/decryption can be done in parallel.\n",
    "* Errors affect only corresponding block.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Maps any message size → fixed-length hash (digest).\n",
    "* Used for verifying data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pre-image resistance:** Hard to find message from hash.\n",
    "* **Second pre-image resistance:** Hard to find different message with same hash.\n",
    "* **Collision resistance:** Hard to find two messages with same hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Hashes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* MD5 (128 bits) — outdated, not collision resistant.\n",
    "* SHA-1 (160 bits) — weakened, collisions found.\n",
    "* SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512 — strong and widely used.\n",

    "## 8. Message Authentication Codes (MAC)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Small piece of data added to message to verify it wasn't changed.\n",
    "* Uses a secret key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CBC-MAC:** Uses block cipher (like DES) in CBC mode, outputs last block as MAC.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **HMAC:** Combines secret key with hash function (like SHA-256). More secure and widely used.\n",
