    "## 1. Introduction to Assembly\n",
    "\n",
    "* **C programs are compiled** into binary machine code that the CPU executes.\n",
    "* **Assembly language** is a human-readable form very close to machine code, using labels instead of raw addresses.\n",
    "* Different CPUs use different assembly languages (called dialects).\n",
    "* This workshop focuses on **x86-64 assembly**, common in most personal computers.\n",
    "* Understanding assembly helps you know what happens when high-level programs run and is key for understanding low-level cybersecurity attacks.\n",
    "* Use **[https://godbolt.org/](https://godbolt.org/)** to explore assembly generated from C code interactively.\n",
    "* You don’t need to write assembly yourself but understand it.\n",

    "## 2. Registers\n",
    "\n",
    "* Registers are tiny, super-fast storage areas inside the CPU (nanoseconds speed).\n",
    "* On x86-64, there are **16 general-purpose registers** each storing **64 bits (8 bytes)**.\n",
    "* Registers are named historically:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * First 8: `rax`, `rbx`, `rcx`, `rdx`, `rsi`, `rdi`, `rsp`, `rbp`.\n",
    "  * These can be accessed partially:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Full 64-bit: e.g., `rax`\n",
    "    * Lower 32-bit: `eax` (replaces `r` with `e`)\n",
    "    * Lower 16-bit: `ax` (remove `r` and `e`)\n",
    "    * Lower 8-bit or second 8-bit parts exist (like `al` and `ah`), but not covered here.\n",
    "  * Next 8 registers: `r8` to `r15` with variants like `r8d` (32-bit), `r8w` (16-bit), `r8b` (8-bit).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Stack Registers\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **stack** stores function local variables.\n",
    "* Two special registers manage the stack:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **`rsp` (Stack Pointer):** Points to the top of the stack (next free space).\n",
    "  * **`rbp` (Base Pointer):** Points to the start of the current function’s stack frame.\n",
    "* `rsp` moves as we push/pop data; `rbp` stays fixed to reference variables in the current function.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 Our First Program in Assembly\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simple C program adds two numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "void main() {\n",
    "    int num1 = 1;\n",
    "    int num2 = 2;\n",
    "    int result = num1 + num2;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Corresponding assembly steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Set up the stack:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `push rbp` saves old base pointer.\n",
    "    * `mov rbp, rsp` sets base pointer to current stack top.\n",
    "  * **Store variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `mov DWORD PTR [rbp-4], 1` stores `num1` at `rbp - 4` (stack grows downward).\n",
    "    * `mov DWORD PTR [rbp-8], 2` stores `num2` at `rbp - 8`.\n",
    "  * **Load variables into registers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `mov edx, DWORD PTR [rbp-4]` loads `num1` into `edx` (32-bit register).\n",
    "    * `mov eax, DWORD PTR [rbp-8]` loads `num2` into `eax`.\n",
    "  * **Add:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `add eax, edx` adds `edx` to `eax`, result in `eax`.\n",
    "  * **Store result back:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `mov DWORD PTR [rbp-12], eax` stores result at `rbp - 12`.\n",
    "  * **Cleanup:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `pop rbp` restores old base pointer.\n",
    "    * `ret` returns from function.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `DWORD PTR` means 4 bytes (size of int).\n",
    "  * Stack addresses use `[rbp - offset]` since stack grows down.\n",
    "  * Registers are used for fast computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 3. Calling Functions & Calling Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assembly functions are placed one after another.\n",
    "* Calling a function means jumping to its address.\n",
    "* **Passing parameters:** Must follow system-specific rules called **calling conventions**.\n",
    "* Example conventions:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * On Windows: first argument in `rcx`.\n",
    "  * On Linux: first argument in `rdi`.\n",
    "* Registers can be used by functions, so conventions define who saves/restores what to avoid losing data.\n",
    "* Example C program with function call:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "int add(int a, int b) {\n",
    "    return a + b;\n",
    "}\n",
    "void main() {\n",
    "    int num1 = 1;\n",
    "    int num2 = 2;\n",
    "    printf(\"%d plus %d is %d\\n\", num1, num2, add(num1, num2));\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assembly steps for calling `add`:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Prepare stack frame (`push rbp`, `mov rbp, rsp`).\n",
    "  * Move arguments into registers (`rdi` = `num1`, `rsi` = `num2` for Linux).\n",
    "  * Call `add` (`call add`), which:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Saves caller’s `rbp`.\n",
    "    * Moves arguments to local variables.\n",
    "    * Adds values and returns result in `eax`.\n",
    "    * Restores `rbp` and returns.\n",
    "  * `main` then calls `printf` with the format string and values.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Arrays and the Heap in Assembly\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example C code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "void main() {\n",
    "    int* nums = (int*)malloc(3 * sizeof(int));\n",
    "    nums[0] = 1;\n",
    "    nums[1] = 2;\n",
    "    printf(\"The array is at %p\\n\", nums);\n",
    "    printf(\"The second number is %d\\n\", nums[1]);\n",
    "    free(nums);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assembly details:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Call `malloc` with `edi` = size (e.g., 12 bytes).\n",
    "  * `malloc` returns pointer in `rax`.\n",
    "  * Store values at `[rax]` and `[rax + 4]` (each int = 4 bytes).\n",
    "  * Call `printf` to print the pointer and a value.\n",
    "  * Call `free` to release memory.\n",
    "* Arrays in C are pointers to memory addresses.\n",
    "* Access memory via pointers by dereferencing (`[rax]` means contents at address in `rax`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Compiler Optimizations\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compilers can optimize code to make it smaller and faster with flags like `-O1`, `-O2`, `-O3`.\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * If variables are declared but not used, compiler may remove all code (`ret` only).\n",
    "  * If variables are constant and only used in functions like `printf`, compiler computes results in advance and avoids extra instructions.\n",
    "  * XOR of a register with itself is used to zero a register efficiently (`xor eax, eax` sets `eax` to 0).\n",
    "  * Jump (`jmp`) instead of call/ret can be used for faster execution.\n"
