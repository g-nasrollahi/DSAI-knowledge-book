    "## 1. What is GDB?\n",
    "\n",
    "* GDB (GNU Debugger) lets you **run and control** programs, **pause** them at specific points, and **inspect memory, variables, and registers**.\n",
    "* It’s useful for debugging and especially important in cybersecurity when source code is not available.\n",
    "* You can start GDB from the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  gdb program_name\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* In GDB, type `run` to start the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Debug Information in Executables\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compilers usually add **debug symbols** to executables to help debugging (function names, variable info).\n",
    "* Using `gcc -g` adds debug info; `gcc -s` strips it (makes debugging harder).\n",
    "* Without debug info, GDB can’t easily stop at function names, so you must use memory addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Breakpoints — Pausing Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "* Breakpoints stop the program at specific points so you can inspect it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Setting Breakpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stop at function start prologue (first instruction of function setup):\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```gdb\n",
    "  break *function_name\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* Stop just after function prologue (start of “real” function code):\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```gdb\n",
    "  break function_name\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* Stop at specific instruction address:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```gdb\n",
    "  break *0xaddress\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* You can also do relative breakpoints like:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```gdb\n",
    "  break *main+12\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  (12 bytes after main’s start)\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Controlling Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step **one assembly instruction** at a time:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```gdb\n",
    "  stepi  # or si\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* Continue running until next breakpoint or program ends:\n",

    "### 3.3 Managing Breakpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "* List all breakpoints:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```gdb\n",
    "  info breakpoints\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* Disable/enable breakpoints:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```gdb\n",
    "  disable breakpoint_number\n",
    "  enable breakpoint_number\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* Ignore breakpoint a number of times before stopping:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```gdb\n",
    "  ignore breakpoint_number times\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* Delete breakpoints:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```gdb\n",
    "  delete breakpoint_number  # or delete all\n",

    "## 4. Viewing Assembly Code (Disassemble)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use Intel syntax for consistency:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```gdb\n",
    "  set disassembly-flavor intel\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* Show assembly of current function:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
