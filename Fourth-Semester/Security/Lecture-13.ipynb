    "- **Differential Privacy (DP)**: A **mathematical way** to keep individual data private while still analyzing datasets by adding some “noise” or randomness to the data or output so individual info is hidden. This noise is carefully designed to mask any single individual’s contribution but still give accurate overall results.\n",
