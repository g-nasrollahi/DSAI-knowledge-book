    "* Goal: Find weights $W$ that minimize the loss function (error between prediction and true label).\n",
    "* For simple linear regression, you solve for weights by setting derivative to zero (closed-form).\n",

    "* **Gradient descent** is an iterative algorithm that updates weights to reduce loss.\n",
    "* It moves weights opposite to the gradient (slope) of the loss.\n",
    "* Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Calculate gradient (how loss changes w\\.r.t. weights).\n",
    "  2. Update weights by a small step (learning rate × gradient).\n",
    "  3. Repeat until loss stops decreasing.\n",

    "### Back-propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Back-propagation computes gradients for all weights efficiently using the **chain rule** of calculus.\n",
    "* It calculates gradients layer by layer from the output layer back to the input layer.\n",
    "* This lets gradient descent know how to update each weight.\n",

    "### Improving Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calculating gradients over the whole dataset (batch gradient descent) is slow.\n",
    "* Variants to speed up training:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Batch Gradient Descent:** Uses the whole dataset per update.\n",
    "  * **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** Updates weights after each training example.\n",
    "  * **Mini-batch Gradient Descent:** Uses small groups (batches) of data per update (common in practice)."
